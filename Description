Student's Performance Dashboard.
(Login Id and Password based access to dashboard created in Qlik Sense cloud (Trial Edition{no section Access}).

There are Three different usergroups in the Data.
1. Principals: who can see the dashboards of all the students along with that they can also add users or remove users (using Admin Page) and can control their access to dashboards.
2. Teachers: who can see the dasboards of those students only who are in their Class. They don't have access to admin Page.
3. Students: who can only see their dashboard and no control over admin Page.

*All the users have different user id and password.
*Entering wrong password or user id will not load the dashboard.

All the Datasets used in the dashboard are created by me.
This Dashboard is created on Qlik Sense Cloud (Trial Edition) without using Section Acess.

Shortcomings of the Dashboard: 
1. Tried making the image of each student dynamic using url but was unable to do so.
2. Sometimes the dashboard crases for 2-3 sec and restarts to login Page which might be due to limitations of trial edition .
